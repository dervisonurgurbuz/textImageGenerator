The world seems bright and gay down 
et the memories be the advocate of our short life 
when we laughed as we shed tears of joy 
when our hope was rekindled as we moved on middle fire 
that we danced by the landlady my soul
when i lived in spancil hill and plates still
them red i watch her walk down under the trees
as the pointsettas drip in the sun i close
