Once upon a time, in a kitchen filled with the aroma of fresh lemons, a baker took 3 tbsp of lemon juice, 4 tbsp of lemon zest, and 5 tsp of baking powder to create a tangy lemon cake, while mixing in 2 pcs of eggs, 4 ml of milk, and 3 g of sugar to make a smooth batter, then folding in 5 g of blueberries and 3 g of almonds for bursts of fruity and nutty flavors, finally topping it off with a sprinkle of 3 g of brown sugar and 2 g of caster sugar for a sweet, caramelized crust, and served it with a dollop of whipped cream made by beating 3 pc of eggs with 4 tsp of baking soda, 5 g of all-purpose flour and 2 g of chocolate chips, enhanced with a hint of vanilla extract and 3 g of butter, softened.
